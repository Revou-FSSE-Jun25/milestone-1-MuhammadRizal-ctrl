                    I’m a engineer passionate about crafting accessible, responsive digital experiences that are both thoughtfully designed and technically robust. My favorite work lives at the intersection of backend logic and frontend usability, I'm building interfaces that not only work, but feel right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m a fullstack software engineering student at <a href="https://www.revou.co/" target="_blank">RevoU</a> and a Computer Science major at <a href="https://binus.ac.id/" target="_blank">BINUS University</a>. My focus is on backend engineering and system design, while also sharpening my skills in frontend architecture and responsive design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before diving into code, I worked in IT and Customer Support roles at <a href="https://www.sinergy.co.id/" target="_blank">PT Sinergy Informasi Pratama</a>, a system integrator company that provided infrastructure solutions and technical support to major clients like <a href="https://www.btn.co.id/id" target="_blank">BTN</a>, <a href="https://www.bankbjb.co.id/" target="_blank">Bank BJB</a>, <a href="https://www.bpjs-kesehatan.go.id/" target="_blank">BPJS Kesehatan</a>, and several regional government offices. My day-to-day involved solving connectivity issues, checking network configurations, handling VPN failures, and helping users recover from all kinds of unexpected “why-is-this-not-working” moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working in the field taught me more than just tech. It taught me how to stay calm under pressure, communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical users, and solve real problems in real time. Now, I bring that same mindset into software development which is building scalable, maintainable web applications that focus on usability, performance, and a bit less panic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not coding, I’m either playing mini soccer, curating my music <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/romjlu8mc3e7dt8xez7128go5" target="_blank">playlists</a>, or writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@rizalfatkhurikh" target="_blank">Medium</a>. I share thoughts about music, life, football, and sometimes just document where I had my latest cup of coffee. All of that will show up here too.
