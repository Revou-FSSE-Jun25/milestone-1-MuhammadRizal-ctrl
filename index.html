                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m a engineer passionate about crafting accessible, responsive digital experiences that are both thoughtfully designed and technically robust. My favorite work lives at the intersection of backend logic and frontend usability, I'm building interfaces that not only work, but feel right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m a fullstack software engineering student at <a href="https://www.revou.co/" target="_blank">RevoU</a> and a Computer Science major at <a href="https://binus.ac.id/" target="_blank">BINUS University</a>. My focus is on backend engineering and system design, while also sharpening my skills in frontend architecture and responsive design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before diving into code, I worked in IT and Customer Support roles at <a href="https://www.sinergy.co.id/" target="_blank">PT Sinergy Informasi Pratama</a>, a system integrator company that provided infrastructure solutions and technical support to major clients like <a href="https://www.btn.co.id/id" target="_blank">BTN</a>, <a href="https://www.bankbjb.co.id/" target="_blank">Bank BJB</a>, <a href="https://www.bpjs-kesehatan.go.id/" target="_blank">BPJS Kesehatan</a>, and several regional government offices. My day-to-day involved solving connectivity issues, checking network configurations, handling VPN failures, and helping users recover from all kinds of unexpected “why-is-this-not-working” moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working in the field taught me more than just tech. It taught me how to stay calm under pressure, communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical users, and solve real problems in real time. Now, I bring that same mindset into software development which is building scalable, maintainable web applications that focus on usability, performance, and a bit less panic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not coding, I’m either playing mini soccer, curating my music <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/romjlu8mc3e7dt8xez7128go5" target="_blank">playlists</a>, or writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@rizalfatkhurikh" target="_blank">Medium</a>. I share thoughts about music, life, football, and sometimes just document where I had my latest cup of coffee. All of that will show up here too.

                        <p>I’m currently enrolled in a 6-month full-time Software Engineering Bootcamp at RevoU, focused on building complete web applications from front to back. On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and accessible interfaces. On the backend, I use Go (Golang), PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker to build RESTful APIs following clean architecture principles. I also practice version control using Git and GitHub, and implement CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to automate deployment. One of the projects I’ve built during the program is this very portfolio website which I designed, coded, and deployed from scratch to showcase my skills and growth as a developer.</p>

                        <h3><a href="https://www.sinergy.co.id/" target="_blank">Manage Service Security Engineer · PT Sinergy Informasi Pratama</a></h3>
                        <p>At Sinergy, I was part of the security operations team that managed Prisma Access (Palo Alto) configurations for BPJS Kesehatan, supporting over 5,000 users across Indonesia. I handled VPN policies, DNS filtering, IP whitelisting, and monitored critical logs to ensure SLA compliance above 95%. I also opened TAC cases with vendors, generated monthly operational reports, and worked closely with client-side teams to deliver secure and stable infrastructure. This role deepened my understanding of cloud security, compliance, and collaboration under pressure those are skills I’m now applying to backend reliability and DevOps practices.</p>

                        <p>I began my career in tech as an IT Support Engineer, where I provided L1–L2 support for 150+ internal users and 10+ external clients including Bank BTN, Bank BJB, and BPJS Kesehatan. I resolved over 200 tickets monthly, troubleshooting network issues, user access problems, Windows Server environments, and Cisco/Ruckus equipment. I also contributed to documentation, SOPs, and on-call rotations, ensuring 24/7 availability. This hands-on experience built my foundation in infrastructure support and gave me a customer-first mindset that I now bring into software development.</p>
